# Advent of Code 2025
This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

Those solutions have been developed as a motive to learn rust.

## Setup a day
Create directory from template:
```
cp -r day_template day_n
```

Add the *example* and your *puzzle input* in files `day_n/data/example.txt` and `day_n/data/data.txt`

Implement the solution in `day_n/rust/src/part_*.rs`

## Run
In `day_n/rust/`:
```
cargo run
```
